= Introduction

A simple script to generate kubernetes manifest files to deploy a https://locust.io[locust.io] cluster.

I've based this on the article published by the https://cloud.google.com/solutions/distributed-load-testing-using-gke[Google Cloud] team.

The main issue with that approach is that you would need to generate a new docker image for each test, seemed a bit overwhelming.

So I changed the manifests to use a initContainer section that pulls the tests from github (where they really should be).

= Running

Assuming you install all dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

```
python locust-deploy.py -h
usage: locust-deploy.py [-h] -n NAME -t TARGET_HOST -r REPO -f TEST_FILE
                        [-s SIZE] [-o OUTPUT]

Locust cluster manifest generator

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n NAME, --name NAME  Name of the test cluster artifacts
  -ns NAMESPACE, --namespace NAMESPACE to run in
  -t TARGET_HOST, --target_host TARGET_HOST
                        Target host to run tests against
  -r REPO, --repo REPO  Github repository containing the tests
  -f TEST_FILE, --test_file TEST_FILE
                        The locust file to be used, relative to the github
                        root path
  -s SIZE, --size SIZE  Number of workers pods to be created. Default to 1
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Manifest files output
```

So for example if you run:

```
python locust-deploy.py -n appengine -t https://<redacted>.appspot.com  -r https://github.com/viniciusccarvalho/locust-tests -f simple/benchmark.py -s 10 -o ~/tmp/locust-deployments
```

on the `~tmp/locust-deployments` folder you will get 4 manifests:

```
-rw-r--r--   1 vinnyc  primarygroup   246 Oct 16 17:45 appengine-locust-master-service-lb.yaml
-rw-r--r--   1 vinnyc  primarygroup   352 Oct 16 17:45 appengine-locust-master-service.yaml
-rw-r--r--   1 vinnyc  primarygroup  1415 Oct 16 17:45 appengine-locust-master.yaml
-rw-r--r--   1 vinnyc  primarygroup  1285 Oct 16 17:45 appengine-locust-worker.yaml
```

Just deploy them and you will be able to access the master node via the loadbalancer IP on port 8089

== Docker image

A docker image is provided for the locust application. At the time of this project the official docker image from
locust.io was broken. So instead I pushed one at `viniciusccarvalho/locust`. If you need to replace, just change the `/resources` templates
for the `master` and `worker` files.
